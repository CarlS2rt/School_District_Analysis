# Project Overview

This project is an analysis of standardized test scores in math and reading from across the district. The analysis breaks downs results by school and by grade level. In the course of the original analysis, the data suggested the possibility of academic dishonesty. The district requested a revised analysis omitting the results from Thomas High School's 9th grade class. As a result, Thomas High School's passing averages came down dramatically as the following analysis shows.

## **Results:** 

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

**Summary:** Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
